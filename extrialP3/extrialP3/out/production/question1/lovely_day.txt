Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
A lovely day
lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
